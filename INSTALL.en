* How to make the multi colored puzzle.

you specify the color by one letter.

  color
  r=#FF0000
  b=#0000FF
  c=#cc6600

In the above example, r means red, b means blue, and c means
#cc6600 (brown).

The numbers and the colors are specified by a number and 
a letter.
For example, the color is red and the length is 3, then
you specify
  3r
